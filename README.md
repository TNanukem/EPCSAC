# EPCSAC
This is the offical repository to the Extensible Platform for Cloud Scheduling Algorithm Comparison.

## Overview

The EPCSAC is an online open-source platform developed to help researchers compare scheduling algorithms to allocate tasks into virtual machines inside cloud infrastructures.

When a new algorithm is developed and published, usually it is compared against some famous literature standard algorithms (like the First-Come-First-Served). However, usually is too difficult to compare this new algorithm with other published works and even when this is made, the researchers cannot reproduce the results obtained in the peer-paper.

The EPCSAC comes as a solution to this problem. Using it, researchers can select different configurations to an fictional datacenter and then test how well their algorithm performs. Then, they can compare their performance against other published algorithms inside our database, this way, their research is improved and more data is gathered to help in the analysis of this new algorithm.

## To-do

Right now the project is still being developed by Tiago Toledo, the to-do list below lists all the features that still needs to be added to the project before it is completely available to be improved by others developers.
