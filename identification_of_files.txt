Users folders are identified by their id number.
---> 25 --> Refers to user 25

Algorithms are in the format: id_user-id_algorithm-vVersion
---> 1-25-v2 --> Refers to the algorithm 25, version 2 of user 1

Simulation results are in the format: d_user-id_algorithm-vVersion-parameters_id-xid_algorithm2-vVersion2
---> 3-21-v3-155-x15-v2 --> Refers to a comparation between algorithm 21 version 3 against the
algorithm 15 version 2 using the parameters 155, request by user 3.
